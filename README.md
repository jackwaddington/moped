# moped

Build a containerised service that pulls data from googl esheets that shows:
	date
	odometer
	amount of fuel
	cost of fuel/l
	total spend

Use an api to ask things like what is mpg, or also to see when should there be a service or oil change.


I want to go into more detail of how the fuel stuff is calculated - i think there are some mistakes there.

i want to be able to say how much 1km costs.
