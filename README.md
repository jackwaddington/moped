Using google forms I have been recording:
	date
	odometer
	amount of fuel
	cost of fuel/l
	total spend


This is stored in a google sheets document. I want to pull the data from that document and add some data - for example for any way, we can pull info.

And by making calculations based on the data we are recording, we can work out:
- fuel effiency in l/100km.
- fuel cost per km
- do these numbers change over time? (i expect not) (or is this something we would like to see visualised?)
- cost of fuel per month (tricky one because we don't fill up once a month)
- we should be able to approximate km for any day - by diff between fill up date and next fill up date.


Use an api to ask things like what is mpg, or also to see when should there be a service or oil change.


I want to go into more detail of how the fuel stuff is calculated - i think there are some mistakes there.

i want to be able to say how much 1km costs.


we need to check ranges of data - we should know if km goes down, we should know if there are any big changes in economy etc.
